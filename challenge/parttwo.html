            <strong>Congratulations on completing part 1!</strong>

            <br><br><br>

            After a moment of celebration, you stare at the number: 72657676 - your previous answer

            <br><br>

            Hmm... what is this odd number? 

            <br><br>

            With curiosity you ask one of your robot friends what this number might be representing - 
            they tell you that this represents a word, and that it can be solved by splitting the number into 4 equal pieces... 
            <br><br>
            As you're about to ask them what they mean by that, they interrupt - 
            "Now it is your job to figure out what the word might be." and immediately vanish into the darkness mumbling: "128... 128..." 
            <br><br>

            Your mission is to identify the word!! (hint: 128)
            <br><br><br>
