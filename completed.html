           All the robots shout to your amazement. They congratulate you for your birthday and wish birthday wishes.

           """"Dear Mr Hall,<br>
           &emsp;Initially I thought that I had a bad computer science teacher who just teaches us stuff we've learnt before and is extremely strict on punctuality. Also, I didn't like your style of teaching, where you barely taught us the content but instead mostly let us get along with the repls. I remember texting someone that he's quote unquote 'lazy'. Also, the worksheets are almost univesally hated as theory is understandably, boring. Oh, I'm glad that you've proven me wrong.<br>
           &emsp;As time went on, I adapted to the independent style of working. As computing isn't necessarily my strength, and a lot of code application demands excessive thinking, I learnt to use my brain instead of asking people (I sat with Lucas lol, we're still friends nothing personal), a transferable skill that I'm really fortunate to possess.<br>
           &emsp;Also, coding has often been a source of frustration for me, as seen in my occasional breakdowns. Your constructive comments and helpful guidance, especially when I'm stuck on problems (such as the notorious AOC 2023 day 1), has guided me forward through my ups and lows. You're my role model for me when it comes to the tone towards giving advices to my friends in life.<br>
           &emsp;It is also apparent to me that you have spent a lot of time planning and structuring your lessons. You are the first teacher I'm aware of who makes all your teaching resources, including admirably a website and a server. (But let's face it, I'm not that surprised given that you're such a committed COMPUTER SCIENCE teacher) Also, your varied lessons are very fun. The most memorable one for me so far is the network one where you asked us to use strings to represent cables, and rings for packets. That was so creative and lovely!!!<br>
           &emsp;But let's forget the meme that you occasionally pulls out lessons that no one understands what's going on. Yet the Java script lesson turns out to be extremely helpful coincidentally: I got my idea of adding a puzzle input into the website from this lesson, and out of pure laziness I dumped it to Yuri to figure it out.<br>
           &emsp;Don't hate it; she's just better.<br><br>
         
           &emsp;Regardless it was my greatest pleasure being your student. Yes, theory is boring and coding is hard, but with you I am sure I'll get there.<br>
         <br><br>
         Happy birthday, and good luck with taking care of your daughter: always priortise your family, we get it.<br>

         """Dear Mr Hall, <br><br>

         Happy birthday! <br>
         Thank you for being our computer science teacher, your lessons make practicals really fun and theory lessons much more easier to understand despite how complicated the concept is. 
         The amount of confidence you gave me in coding is immeasurable and I really appreciate the activities that try to challenge us to learn more advanced content, which made me more interested in the subject. 
         At the start of year 10, I didn't expect myself to be this excited for every computer science lesson, but your massive efforts in teaching has always kept me engaged. 
         Moreover, the unique points you point out and give advice to has made me have a broader perspective and I also admire your logical way of understanding a problem, which I try to incorporate. <br><br>
         Have a nice birthday!
         <br><br>
         Best regards, <br>
         Yuri"""
