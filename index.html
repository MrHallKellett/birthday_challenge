        <p>Your birthday is… <strong>TODAY!</strong> After kindly inviting you to a party in the world of Compscinetan, your friends have bought you a birthday cake.
            <br><br>
            Oh… what a lovely group of robots! I wish they could sing ‘Happy Birthday to You’ all day.
            <br><br>
            Instead, these horrible creatures demanded you to cut the birthday cake - a chore that nobody really likes to do, in fact.
            <br><br>
            Even worse, they demanded you to cut the pieces according to the <strong>length of the aerials</strong> that they have above their heads. Your task is to find out the denominator of the percentage of the smallest slice of cake.
            <br><br>
            As the unspoken rules of Compscinetan state (by now you should already know them tho; I’m just reiterating), robots who have <strong>aerials longer or equal to than the length of the birthday bot’s aerial</strong> do not qualify to share a slice of cake. Also, bots whose aerials’ lengths, <strong>when converted to cm, is an integer</strong>, do not qualify either.
            <br><br>
            After a series of intense research, querying and surveying, you have found out the lengths of the aerials of each of your friends, and you have listed them in your notebook. 
            <br><br>
            For example, consider the list below:
            <br>
            </p>

            <div>
            <code class="codepart" id="example">
            Mine	411989<br>
            Alex	872477<br>
            Ben	96344<br>
            Charlotte	109030<br>
            Daniel	932072<br>
            Emily	262419<br>
            </code>
            </div>

            <p>
            <br>
            To find out, check the lengths of each of your friends’ aerials.
            <br><br>
            Obviously your aerial qualifies, as the birthday bot deserves a slice of cake.<br>
            &emsp;- Alex’s aerial is 872477 mm long, longer than yours. <br>
            &emsp;- Ben’s aerial is 96344 mm long, shorter than yours. <br>
            &emsp;- Charlotte’s aerial is 109030 mm long, shorter than yours. However, it does not qualify to enjoy a slice of cake as 109030 mm, when converted to cm, is an integer (10903 cm) <br>
            &emsp;- Daniel’s aerial is 932072 mm long, longer than yours. <br>
            &emsp;- Emily’s aerial is 262419 mm long, shorter than yours.
            <br><br>
            And so, you divide the cake into 3 portions - for yourself, Ben, and Emily. Check the proportion of each slice:
            <br><br>
            
            Yours: <code class="codepart">411989 ÷ (411989 + 96344 + 262419)</code> = <code class="codepart">0.5345286162</code><br>
            Ben’s: <code class="codepart">96344 ÷ (411989 + 96344 + 262419)</code> = <code class="codepart">1/8</code><br>
            Emily’s: <code class="codepart">262419 ÷ (411989 + 96344 + 262419)</code> = <code class="codepart">0.3404713838</code><br>
            
            <br>
            Since Ben’s slice is the smallest, the answer should be taken from the denominator of his portion: <strong>8</strong>.
            <br><br>
            However, the turnout at your party was far greater than anticipated; get your finalised list of robots and their aerials’ lengths to find out the answer.
